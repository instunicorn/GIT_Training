There are things,
I have done
There's a place,
I have gone
There's a beast,
And I let it run
Now it's runnin' my way
There are things,
I regret
That you can't forgive
You can't forget
There's a gift,
That you sent
You sent it my way
So, take this night
Wrap it around me like a sheet
I know I'm not forgiven,
But I need a place to sleep
So, take this night
Lay me down on the street
I know I'm not forgiven,
But I hope that I'll be given
Some peace
